Players and Cards

---

The game is for two to seven players, using a complete suit from a standard\
52-card pack for each player plus one extra suit. Two decks are needed for\
four or more players. Cards rank Ace \
(low), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K (high). As a prize, \
the Ace is worth 1 point, cards 2-10 face value, Jack 11, \
Queen 12 and King 13.

Setup

---

The cards are sorted into suits. One suit (traditionally diamonds) is \
turned face down and presented as a prize pile by the bot. \
Each of the other players takes one complete suit.

Play

---

A random card from the prize pile is selected by the bot randomly. \
Then each player selects a card from their pile and try to bid \
for the prize on a private chat with the bot. When all players\
finish bidding, the bot anounces what everyone bided and who\
the winner of the round is. The winner get to add the won \
card to their pile of won cards. Then another card \
will be selected by the bot and players bid for it \
in the same way they run out of their cards. If \
two players put the highest bid, the bid doesn't \
count, but the prize card remains on offer in \
the next round along with the next round's prize.\
The same thing happens if two people or more \
players bid the highest bid in a round \
until some one wins all the acumulated \
prize. If the tie keeps happening \
until the end, the accumulated prize is discarded once \
all the players run out of cards to play with.

Scoring

---

When all players run out of bid cards the play ends.\
Each player totals the value of the diamonds they \
have won in bids (ace=1, 2-10 face value, J=11, Q=12, K=13) \
and the greater total wins the game.

Variation (Future version)

---

Inorder to hanndle ties Another card is turned from the prize \
pile and the players bid again. It needs \
to be agreed whether players not involved \
in the original tie for highest are eligible to \
win in the second round of bidding.
